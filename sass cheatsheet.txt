After you have downloaded and install ruby (on windows)…

    1. Open the terminal
    2. type ruby -v (to check version)
    3. gem install sass (If Sass is not already installed)
    4. Create a directory for your project and add a css and scss folder in that project folder.
    5. Create a main.scss file in your scss directory that imports all your other .scss files ( @import ‘filename’; )
    6. Go to your project directory
    7. type sass – -watch scss:css
    8. Sass will automatically generate a main.css file in the css directory
